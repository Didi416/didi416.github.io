            <p>
              I'm passionate about designing sustainable systems in robotics,
              bringing together multiple perspectives to solve complex problems.
              Currently pursuing a double degree in Engineering (Mechatronics)
              and Creative Intelligence & Innovation at UTS.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of the UTS
              Aerospace Society, where I lead the technical team in designing
              and building innovative aerospace projects, like the current
              Flight Simulator Rig and High Altitude Balloon Launch systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am intrigued by the multitude of possibilities engineering has
              to offer, specifically around the concepts of automation and
              robotics, 3D printing/additive manufacturing, as well as anything
              aviation related!

            My professional experiences have allowed me to merge engineering
            expertise with creative problem-solving. Working with startups and
            industry professionals, I’ve developed skills in prototyping, user
            engagement, and systems-thinking, while learning how to translate
            technical complexity into meaningful outcomes for real stakeholders.

            I have had the chance to participate in many engineering and
            transdisciplinary projects over the past few years at university,
            some successful, some less so, but I have learnt from all
            experiences and carry them on in future projects. Throughout my
            tertiary education, I’ve also learned that stepping beyond
            engineering frameworks unlocks more socially impactful and
            innovative solutions. I apply iterative design methodologies that
            emphasise adaptability, stakeholder feedback, and continuous
            reflection.

              include skills in mechanical and electronic design, programming
              languages geared towards automation and robotics, suhc as
              C++/Python/XML, as well as for developmental purposes, such as VBA
              macros and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (I coded this website from scratch
